# Color_Recognition

The program reads an image from path provided by the user. After clicking on the image it shows the name of the hue of the clicked part. I used "colors.csv" file and modified it to satisfy the program's needs. I added a "Hue" colomn to colors.csv database and changed the "name" column's values to Hue's names.

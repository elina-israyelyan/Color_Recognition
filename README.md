# Color_Recognition

The program reads an image from path provided by the user. After clicking on the image it shows the name of the hue of the clicked part.
I added a "Hue" colomn to colors.csv database and changed the "name" column's values to Hue's names. The "colors_names_.csv" is the 
database with the new columns.
